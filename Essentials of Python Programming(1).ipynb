It refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, typically a class. Encapsulation also involves restricting direct access to some of an object's components, which is a means of preventing unintended interference and misuse of the data. This is typically achieved through the use of access modifiers.\n","\n","###Key Points of Encapsulation\n","1. Data Hiding: Encapsulation allows data to be hidden within a class, ensuring that it can only be accessed or modified through specific methods. This is usually done using private or protected access modifiers.\n","2. Controlled Access: By providing public methods (getters and setters), encapsulation allows controlled access to the internal state of an object. This ensures that the data remains valid and consistent.\n","3. Modularity: Encapsulation helps in organizing the code into modular and maintainable units. Each class can be developed and tested independently.\n","4.
